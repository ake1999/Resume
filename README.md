# Relevant Work Experience

## Robotics Researcher

**Research Team Member --- University Of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran** **JAN
2019 - JAN 2021**

#### Setting up its servo motor driver to work with Advantech PCI cards.

#### Setting it up to work with ROS.

#### Stimulating robot in Gazebo software.

#### Designing a controller and motion planning for it in ROS environments.

## Computer Vision Engineer

**Internship --- Novinilya Company, Isfahan, Iran** **JUN 2019 - AUG
2019**

#### I worked with Novinilya company to survey the surface quality of components in the factories' production line.

#### I worked with the R&D team of the company to use embedded boards (Jetson TX1) and also worked with industrial cameras(Basler cameras) for classifying objects by CNN.

# Academic Projects

## Artificial Intelligence
